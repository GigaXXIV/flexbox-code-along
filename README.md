# Flexbox

### Getting Started

1. Fork this repo and `git clone` it down to your computer
1. The folder `metropolis` contains font files (don't worry about them! They are good to go!)
1. `index.html` - it is already set up for you
1. `starter.css` - a little bit of css to get us started - it is already set up for you
1. `main.css` - this is the ONLY file that you will be coding in for this morning's exercise
